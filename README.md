# Social-media-Sentiment-Analysis
	
Sentiment analysis is tool which provide you with essential knowledge. Think about parameters like:
	engagement rate;
	social media reach;
	number of likes and comments;
	social media shares.
All of these numbers give you insights into how your audience is responding.
 
Our idea for implementing “social media sentiment analysis using twitter database” by using python and machine learning algo.


About the code:
  1)Tweepy: using this library we are accessing the dataset  of twitter.
  2)clean tweet: It remove the links and special character which are not used in analysis.
  3)fetched_tweet: In get_tweet, we use to call the Twitter API to fetch tweets
  4)Textbolb : using this library the program running different processes. 
      Tokenization, POS and pass the tokens for sentiment analysis.
      
This code give us analysis of the query. The output of this code give us percentage of the query as positive, negative or neutral.

We will improve it and we have some ideas on our mind like we can use it to get movie reviews, get the list of trending topics and analysis of all those topic, and using different database and nltk as our next source code.
