# Social-media-Sentiment-Analysis

Our project is on Twitter Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.Our Project takes a keyword/hashtag and number of tweets ,to analyse from, as inputs and plots a pie chart for the same.

Technology used:
Sentiment analysis combines natural language programming(NLP), text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.
